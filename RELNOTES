Release Notes for gtkmail-1.1.0
===============================
This is a fully functional release.  It supports both local (mbox) and
remote (imap) mailboxes. Imap can be done either through raw TCP or SSL,
given server support.  PGP crypto is available through gnupg.

There is also an automagic spam forwarding feature.  If possible, it
tries to find out where the spam came from and writes a complaint
letter to the spammer's ISP.  It works sometimes, but given the nature
of email a clever spammer can always hide his origin.

The UI features simultaneous access to multiple mailboxes, and is massively 
multithreaded.  Actions within a mailbox are both prioritized and queued.

README for gtkmail-1.1.2
------------------------
gtkmail is a GUI mail client for GNOME.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
1. gcc-3.0         <http://gcc.gnu.org>
2. libsigc++-1.0.3 <http://libsigc.sourceforge.net>
3. openssl         <http://www.openssl.org>
3. jlib-1.1.1      <http://jlib.sourceforge.net>

6. gtkmm-1.2.7     <http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net>
7. gnomemm-1.2.1   <http://gtkmm.sourceforge.net>


INSTALLATION
------------
See the file INSTALL for details.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Copy the sample.config.xml to 
	
	$HOME/.gtkmail/config.xml

Be sure you set up at least one mailbox; the examples should be sufficient

If you don't do this, gtkmail will create a simple config.xml for you.  It will try
to load an mbox style mailbox from $HOME/mail.

To use the address book, copy the sample.address.xml to 

    $HOME/.gtkmail/address.xml

For now, addresses must be inserted manually into this file.  

Other configuration options can be specified.  See sample.config.xml for examples.


EXECUTION
---------
When gtkmail starts up, it will try to get folder listings for all mailboxes in
your config.xml.  Once this happens, click on a folder to get email listings.
Double click on a message to view it.

All messages are opened in their own top level windows.  This was a specific choice
I made.  DON'T email me and ask me to add a viewing frame into the main window.

All mailboxes operate completely independently of each other.  Within a mailbox,
actions are prioritized and queued.  Viewing and saving have the highest priority, 
then (un)deletion, then expunging, then checking.

Mailboxes can be configured from the Settings menu using a Druid.  Thanks GNOME.

If you want to use PGP support, you need to have gpg installed. 

To activate the address book, type <enter> while entering addresses on the To: or Cc: 
lines.
